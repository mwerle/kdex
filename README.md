## About
The *Kerbal Dust Experiment* by masTerTorch is a replica of [LADEE]s [LDEX] instrument. It comes with an animated model and many individualised science results.

Inspired by the [NASA] mission [LADEE]. The objective of [LADEE] was to investigate the mysteries of the lunar atmosphere and the question of levitated lunar dust. It carried a scientific instrument called the Lunar Dust Experiment ([LDEX]). This instrument was an impact ionization dust detector. In this way it was possible to measure the density of dust particles.

Kerbals are known for impacts and collisions and since 0.22 they do science. KDEX combines impacts and science.

This part is giving you the opportunity to do science the Kerbal way!

	#KDEX_SD_title = Dust Analysis

	#KDEX_SD_default = The collided grains seem to be rather small.

	#KDEX_SD_InSpace = The dust forms into a pancake-shaped cloud. This could cause a counterglow.

	#KDEX_SD_KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = The entering grains consists of burnt rocket fuel particles.
	#KDEX_SD_KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The particles seem to consist mainly of brake dust and rubber particles from tyres.
	#KDEX_SD_KerbinSrfLandedKSC = There is evidence that the dust consists of pollen, kerbal hairs, and spacesuit fibers.
	#KDEX_SD_KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = The density of the grains seems to be very similar to that of pollen... Achoo!
	#KDEX_SD_KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = Lots of heavy collisions which almost damage the sensor. This is quite a dusty place.
	#KDEX_SD_KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = You can find similar dust on your bookshelves.
	#KDEX_SD_KerbinFlyingLowShores = A loose granular material. Probably the same as that blanketing the beaches, riverbeds, and deserts of Kerbin.
	#KDEX_SD_KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = Dust with a complex spectral signature incoming.
	#KDEX_SD_KerbinFlyingLowWater = The incoming particles seem to be rather moist.
	#KDEX_SD_KerbinFlyingLowTundra = The incoming particles appear to be ice crystals.
	#KDEX_SD_KerbinInSpaceLow = We found evidence of extremely fine particles of mineral dust.
	#KDEX_SD_KerbinInSpaceHigh = A different dust up here. It seems to form into strange shapes.

	#KDEX_SD_MunInSpaceHigh = This dust is fine like talcum powder, but kind of evil. It follows electric field lines and works its way into equipment.
	#KDEX_SD_MunInSpaceLow = High Densities! Good impact rate. Dust at low altitude should be able to cast a glow on sunset.
	#KDEX_SD_MunInSpaceLowTwinCraters = After every grain collision follows a twin collision with the same charge.
	#KDEX_SD_MunInSpaceLowEastFarsideCrater = Lower collision rate, but heavy impacts.
	#KDEX_SD_MunInSpaceLowMidlandCraters = Lower collision rate and weak impacts.
	#KDEX_SD_MunInSpaceLowMidlands = Collision rate and impacts on an mean level.
	#KDEX_SD_MunInSpaceLowHighlands = The dust grains have a high charge. 
	#KDEX_SD_MunInSpaceLowPolarLowlands = Very few grains are entering the sensor. Perhaps it is too cold.
	#KDEX_SD_MunInSpaceLowFarsideCrater = Almost no collision, weak impacts.
	#KDEX_SD_MunSrfLanded = Truth! The Munar exosphere contains dust due to electrostatic levitation.

	#KDEX_SD_MinmusInSpaceHigh = Almost no impacts. Density is lower than the density of water, but higher than the density of our cafeteria mint ice.
	#KDEX_SD_MinmusInSpaceLowHighlands = We did find sulphate coatings on the ionized dust particles.
	#KDEX_SD_MinmusInSpaceLowMidlands = The can of our instrument looks like a mint sundae.
	#KDEX_SD_MinmusInSpaceLowLowlands = These results suggest that the particles being deposited have different composition to those still at higher altitudes.
	#KDEX_SD_MinmusInSpaceLowSlopes = Low level dust.
	#KDEX_SD_MinmusInSpaceLowGreatFlats = Notably no sulphate particles are present in the dust sampled. Indicating a lack of anthropogenic pollution.
	#KDEX_SD_MinmusInSpaceLowGreaterFlats = Traces of dust from gypsum, quartz, NaCl (which may be sea salt or mineral halite), calcium rich particles, and calcium carbonates.
	#KDEX_SD_MinmusInSpaceLowLesserFlats = The sensor indicates a moderate dust storm is in progress.
	#KDEX_SD_MinmusInSpaceLowFlats = Composition of particles with diameter greater than 1mm.
	#KDEX_SD_MinmusInSpaceLowPoles = Finding a lack of coatings on the ionized dust particles.

	#KDEX_SD_GillyInSpaceLow = Dust with silicate cores colliding in the back of the instrument.
	#KDEX_SD_GillySrfLanded = These grains have a sooty mantle consisting of amorphous carbon.

	#KDEX_SD_MohoInSpaceLow = Density is almost as high as the density of flying ash.
	#KDEX_SD_MohoSrfLanded = Fine powder made up of glassy spheres from sub-micron to more than 100 microns in size. Specific gravity 1.9 to 2.4 and a bulk density of 0.8-1 ton per cubic meter.

	#KDEX_SD_EveInSpaceLow = The dust is glass like. Strong impacts incoming.
	#KDEX_SD_EveFlying = The heavy impacts and the high collision rate are quite a stress test.

	#KDEX_SD_DunaInSpaceLow = Incoming Grains vary in size between a few tenths of a nanometer to a few microns.
	#KDEX_SD_DunaSrfLanded = The dust is quite grainy and shows sand like collisions.

	#KDEX_SD_IkeInSpaceLow = Dust particles are few and far between.
	#KDEX_SD_IkeSrfLanded = Only a few dust particles are entering the sensor. We should have brought a shovel.

	#KDEX_SD_DresInSpaceLow = The dust seems to be composed of carbonaceous, silicate, and metallic grains.
	#KDEX_SD_DresSrfLanded = The dust is so dense that it absorbs and scatters sun light.

	#KDEX_SD_JoolInSpaceLow = No dust or the grains are too small to be recognized by the instrument.

	#KDEX_SD_LaytheInSpaceLow = The dust tries to form a shape. We observed the same behaviour near Kerbin.
	#KDEX_SD_LaytheSrfLanded = A loose granular material. Probably it consists of calcium carbonate.
	#KDEX_SD_LaytheSrfSplashed = No grains are entering the sensor.

	#KDEX_SD_VallInSpaceLow = Dust tries to form a shape. Lower density than water.
	#KDEX_SD_VallSrfLanded = The cold seems to trap the dust particles on the surface.

	#KDEX_SD_TyloInSpaceLow = Avoid this one, it is just a lot of dust and drag and means nothing in the end.
	#KDEX_SD_TyloSrfLanded = Due to the high gravity the dust clumps together to spheres.

	#KDEX_SD_BopInSpaceLow = The dust is clustering to dense cores.
	#KDEX_SD_BopSrfLanded = Too much dust in the sensor.

	#KDEX_SD_PolInSpaceLow = Dusting this one would be a good start.
	#KDEX_SD_PolSrfLanded = Weak impacts. Probably phosphoric or sulfuric origin.

	#KDEX_SD_EelooInSpaceLow = Dust particles are few and far between. 
	#KDEX_SD_EelooSrfLanded = The Dust consists of CO, silicon carbide, amorphous silicate and lots of ice.
	
	#KDEX_SD_SunInSpaceLow = This close to Kerbal dust particles are popping like popcorn in the sensor can. Perhaps they can be Snacks?!
	#KDEX_SD_SunInSpaceHigh = There's barely any grains of dust hitting the sensor this far out. You feel lonely and small.
